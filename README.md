![First schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdrg/Chrome-Quantum/master/WebStore/preview.png)

Updated for the new Chrome redesign! Please update to Chrome v69 for full compatibility with this theme. 

Incognito mode currently uses a dark colour scheme to distinguish it from normal mode. This theme imitates that colour scheme and applies it throughout the whole browser.

### Installation
Install the theme from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ihgkmcigjabddhkckiglfinbaibdlhkl).

### Github
This theme is fully open-source under the Apache License. Check out the source code on [Github](https://github.com/netdrg/Chrome-Theme-DarkBlue/).

### Limitations
Chrome theme devs currently have no ability to colour the omnibox. As a result, the omnibox will always be white.
